                    cheaper and faster for growing consumer markets. Making cloth, by hand, for pants, shirts, socks,
                    bedspreads, and other domestic items had always required lots of skill and time.</p>

            <p>In its simplest terms, the design-build construction delivery method replaces the traditional method of
                awarding separate contracts for design and construction. The contractor, designers, subcontractors, and
                owner work together as one team to build a project that meets or exceeds the owner's expectations. Team
                members focus on communication, collaboration, and solving problems together rather than pointing
                fingers and placing blame.</p>

                    <p>There are essentially five phases involved in the design-build process, and while this may sound
                        like a lot of steps for a simplified process, it’s important to understand that the phases often
                        overlap. Other construction methods often consist of several steps, which are typically
                        performed by separate entities, and upon completion of the previous. The design-build process is
                        much more fluid. Each member of the design-build team works together during each step of the
                        process to help move things along more quickly and more smoothly. The basic steps include:</p>

                    <p>Though cost is an important factor to consider, it is not (nor should it be) the ONLY factor that
                        influences the final decision. While it may be tempting for owners to choose the lowest price, a
                        smart owner will understand the value of working with a qualified design-builder, and will often
                        choose based primarily on the experience and skills the design-builder offers.</p>
